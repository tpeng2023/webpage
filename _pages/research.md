   <summary>   Abstract</summary>

This paper examines the economic impacts of large theme park openings in China from 2000 to 2023 using a newly compiled dataset on county-level theme parks and entrepreneurship. Leveraging the staggered openings of theme parks across various counties, we document three main findings. First, theme park openings lead to a 12.1% increase in entrepreneurial activities, especially in tourism-related service sectors. This result is robust to the heterogeneous treatment effect, alternative specification, excluding confounding policies, and placebo tests. Second, the spillover effects within a 25-to-50-kilometer radius are concentrated in tourism-related, consumption-based industries, and crowd-out effects within 25 kilometers are mainly in non-service sectors and real estate. Third, we identify tourism-driven consumption and agglomeration as the potential mechanisms driving these economic impacts. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest that theme park openings promote employment by 9.3%. This study sheds new light on the evaluation of the effectiveness of tourism-related place-based policies.

   <summary>   Abstract</summary>

Many countries seek to attract foreign travelers by improving air connectivity. How do direct flight connections affect international visitors' spending? We address this question using a novel dataset on card payments made by Chinese travelers via point-of-sale (POS) terminals. Our identification strategy exploits overseas improvements in air transportation capacityーarising from infrastructure developments, policy changes, and historical eventsーwhich we treat as exogenous supply shocks to flight frequency. Our IV estimates indicate that a 1% increase in the weekly frequency of direct flights leads to a 1.2% increase in cross-border card transaction value. While improving air connectivity promotes international travel, we find that negative shocks to consumer preferences for destination countries, such as boycotts, diminish the positive impact of air connectivity.
