* [Place-based Policy and Entrepreneurship: Evidence from Theme Park Openings]()

(with Chun-Yu Ho)

<details>

   <summary>   Abstract</summary>

This paper examines the economic impacts of large theme park openings in China from 2000
to 2020 using a newly compiled dataset on county-level theme parks and entrepreneurship. Leveraging the staggered openings of theme parks across various counties, we document three main findings. First, theme park openings lead to a 14% increase in entrepreneurial activities, especially in tourism-related service sectors. This result is robust to the instrumental variable approach, the heterogeneous treatment effect, alternative specification and measurement, and propensity score matching. Second, theme park openings generate spillover effects on neighboring counties within a 50-75 kilometer radius. Third, we identify tourism and agglomeration as the potential mechanisms driving these economic impacts. Back-of-the-envelop calculations suggest that theme park openings promote employment by 11% and overall economic activities by 2%-3%. This study sheds new light on the evaluation of the effectiveness of tourism-related place-based policies.

* [Air Connectivity and International Travel: Evidence from Cross-border Card Payments](https://hatakayama.github.io/paper_web/Air_Connectivity_and_Cross_border_Travel.pdf)

(with Chun-Yu Ho, Haruka Takayama, and Li Xu) 
2025

   <summary>   Abstract</summary>

Many countries seek to attract foreign travelers by improving air connectivity. How do direct flight connections affect international visitors' spending? We address this question using a novel dataset on card payments made by Chinese travelers via point-of-sale (POS) terminals. Our identification strategy exploits overseas improvements in air transportation capacityーarising from infrastructure developments, policy changes, and historical eventsーwhich we treat as exogenous supply shocks to flight frequency. Our IV estimates indicate that a 1% increase in the weekly frequency of direct flights leads to a 1.2% increase in cross-border card transaction value. While improving air connectivity promotes international travel, we find that negative shocks to consumer preferences for destination countries, such as boycotts, diminish the positive impact of air connectivity.

* [Supply-induced Litigation and the Role of Informal Institutions]()

(with Chun-Yu Ho, Saoqing Huang, and Mingda Zhang)
2025

<summary>Abstact</summary>

Access to justice is argued to be an integral part of sustainable development and inclusive growth. This paper examines how litigation demand responds to an increased supply of legal professionals, i.e. supply-induced litigation, in a developing economy using a newly constructed city-level panel dataset of litigation rate, law firms, and socioeconomic variables from China throughout 2013-23. Our empirical analysis reaches several conclusions. We find that an increase in the number of law firms has a positive and significant effect on the litigation rate, which supports supply-induced litigation. This result is robust to the instrument variable (IV) estimation. Further, we employ social trust, ethnic diversity, and religiosity as measures for informal institutions and find that supply-induced litigation is more pronounced for cities with higher social trust and lower ethnic diversity. In other words, there is a complementary between formal and informal institutions in driving the use of the judicial system.
