   This paper studies wild bootstrap-based inference for regression models with multiway clustering. Our proposed method is a multiway counterpart to the (one-way) wild cluster bootstrap approach introduced by Cameron et al. (2008). We establish the validity of our method for studentized statistics. Theoretical results are provided, accommodating arbitrary serial dependence in the common time effects -- an aspect excluded by existing two-way bootstrap-based approaches. Simulation experiments document the potential for enhanced inference with our novel approach. We illustrate the effectiveness of the method by revisiting empirical studies involving multiway clustered and correlated data.

   <summary>   Abstract</summary>

This paper introduces a projection-based wild bootstrap (PWB) method for inference
in linear regression models with two-way clustered data. We examine all possible
scenarios for the asymptotic distribution of the estimator—Gaussian and non-
Gaussian—classifying them into five distinct cases. In one scenario, no procedure can
achieve uniform consistency under a fully unspecified DGP, and our method is the first
to cover the remaining four. We identify and apply two diagnostic factors to distinguish
between these scenarios. In addition, our procedure accommodates arbitrary serial dependence.
Simulation results demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of the proposed
method, making it a robust tool for empirical work involving complex clustering structures.

   <summary>   Abstract</summary>

Chiang, Hansen, and Sasaki (2024) and Chen and Vogelsang (2024) developed cluster-robust variance estimators (CRVEs) for handling arbitrary serial dependence in linear regressions with two-way clustered panel data. However, conventional CRVEs often perform poorly in finite samples. We propose improved jackknife CRVEs to enhance inference accuracy. Through extensive simulations, we show that the novel jackknife CRVEs deliver remarkably precise inferences. This strong performance holds even in the presence of two-way  fixed effects. Notably, one of our new approaches significantly mitigates issues of undefined standard errors when CRVEs are not positive definite, ensuring robust and consistent inference across scenarios.

<summary>Abstact</summary>

This paper introduces a novel approach called wild bootstrapping for analyzing mutual fund performance. Our proposed method preserves various characteristics of mutual fund databases, including entry/exit points for each fund (i.e., missing data) and cross-sectional information. We show that our proposed bootstrap tests have a near-optimal size and exhibit greater power compared to widely used standard bootstrap methods for evaluating mutual fund performance. Additionally, we present a novel approach to picking mutual funds that do not underperform others. Our empirical results indicate that a measurable fraction of funds outperform the market. Furthermore, we extend our methods to assess mutual fund market timing abilities.
