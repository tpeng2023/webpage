​I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Economics from State University of New York, at Albany. 

My research interests lie in econometrics, with a particular emphasis on high-dimensional methods—such as the bootstrap and jackknife—for panel and time series data. I am also interested in robust inference methods for both linear and quantile regression models, especially in the presence of heteroskedastic errors, fixed effects (individual or time-specific), serial dependence, and one-way or multi-way clustered dependence.

My long-term objective is to promote the integration of econometric theory into empirical work by developing inference tools that are both robust and easy to implement.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Koomla Ulrich Hounyo.
